# Overview

Welcome to KTB1-mRNA. This repository contains Simulink files and scripts related to the simulation of a continuous biopharmaceutical process.

# Folders

The project contains three different folders, each of which is described in detail below:

Open-loop simulation | contains the scripts and Simulink file for the open-loop simulation.

Closed-loop simulation | contains the scripts and Simulink file for the simulation with closed-loop control.

Closed-loop disturbance simulation | contains the simulation model where disturbances are introduced.
