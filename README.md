# Overview
This repository contains Simulink files and scripts related to the simulation of a continuous biopharmaceutical process.

# Files
Open-loop simulation folder | contains the scripts and Simulink file for the open-loop simulation.\\

Closed-loop simulation folder | contains the scripts and Simulink file for the simulation with closed-loop control.\\

Closed-loop disturbance simulation folder | contains the simulation model where disturbances are introduced.\\

# Installation and Usage
1. Run the necessary scripts before running the Simulink files.
2. Once the scripts are run, you can proceed to run the following Simulink files.
