# Overview
This repository contains Simulink files and scripts related to the simulation of a continuous biopharmaceutical process.

# Folders
Open-loop simulation folder | contains the scripts and Simulink file for the open-loop simulation.

Closed-loop simulation folder | contains the scripts and Simulink file for the simulation with closed-loop control.

Closed-loop disturbance simulation folder | contains the simulation model where disturbances are introduced.
